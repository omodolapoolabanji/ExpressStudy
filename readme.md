This repo would document my progress as I get acquinted with express js for building the backend for applications.

### Getting Started in Express:
    - init an npm project with app.js (or prefered main script) as an entrypoint using npm init
    - install express into the dir -> `npm install express`

    Alternatively, you can generate a skeleton using the express generator
    - ```npx express-generator```

    - list all registered routes using app._router.stack for express() and use router.stack for express.Router()
